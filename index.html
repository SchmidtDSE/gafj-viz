                    Informing a food justice project, this social listening effort asks what is part of the conversation and what is missing when the world discusses food. It asks questions like:
                </div>

                <ul>
                    <li>What are the commonly discussed food challenges?</li>
                    <li>What terms are used to describe common justice topics like food security?</li>
                    <li>What terms come up across different parts of the world when they talk about "good" food and what does that potentially tell us about the priorities or beliefs of those different regions?</li>
                    <li>How do governance, policy, and justice feature in food conversations and how does that vary geographically?</li>
                    <li>How can these data driven insights inform and inspire qualitative research?</li>
                </ul>

                <div>
                    Specifically, using news media as a lens, this natural language processing effort uses machine learning / artificial intelligence to read thousands of articles from across countries and languages to see how often different topics appear and in which context. Distilling this insight into interactive data visualizations, this website provides research tools which enable users to explore this global dataset.

                <h2>Method</h2>
                This <a href="https://medium.com/ideo-colab/natural-language-processing-a-new-way-to-listen-to-people-about-health-8cfe9bece1ce">natural language processing</a> project utilizes a number of technologies to source data and then produce an interactive visualization:

                <ul>
                    <li>News sources are queried through <a href="https://newsdata.io/">Newsdata.io</a> using a filter for articles discussing food.</li>
                    <li>Search parameters are converted to each article's language using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/translate/">Amazon Translate</a>, the same automated system used to convert all article information to a single common language (English: the most common article original language) before additional processing.</li>
                    <li>This application determines the topics of an article by having a machine read and catagorize their contents. This happens through either Method A or Method B.</li>
                    <li>Method A: In an algorithm called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/944919.944937">LDA</a>, the computer examines how often different words appear in articles in general as well as how often they appear together, creating a sense for which words may be in the same topic (like dog and cat) and, thus, which topics a document contains.
                    <li>Method B: After filtering commonly occuring words that may be less useful in determining article topic (<a href="https://www.learndatasci.com/glossary/tf-idf-term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency/">TF-IDF</a>), the words of an article are converted to numbers describing their meaning (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/word2vec-explained-49c52b4ccb71">Word2Vec</a>) where dog and cat may have more similar numbers than dog to truck. Finally, the computer clusters together similar words or, put another way, groups words with similar numbers (<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37456-2_14">HDBSCAN</a>).</li>
                    <li>The team double checks and, when necessary, performs minor refinements of the resulting topics before performing "<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/">affinity diagramming</a>" where topics are clustered further into a smaller number of "categories" as shown in the visualization.</li>
                    <li>A visualization using <a href="https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv">country centroids</a> is built using a technology called <a href="https://sketchingpy.org/">Sketchingpy</a> and deployed to the web.</li>
                </ul>

                This research effort provides a formal description of these methods along with evaluation information and limitations in a <a href="/img/whitepaper.pdf">supplemental whitepaper</a>. The application currently uses Method B. The <a href="https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/gafj-viz">visualization code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/gafj-pipeline">data pipeline code</a> are both open source where the linked repositories provide additional details on open source technologies used. Finally, <a href="/csv/articles.csv">the resulting dataset is available for download</a> under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC-BY-NC License</a> for academic / scientific research purposes only. Current coverage is from Dec 2022 to Nov 2023. See <a href="#about">about section</a> for additional conditions and details.

                    This application records standard server access logs for security and stability reasons, including to prevent abuse. This is a common practice employed by many websites necessary for maintaing application function. This information includes:

                    <ul>
                        <li>IP addresses which describe from which location and internet connection the application is accessed.</li>
                        <li>User agent strings which provide basic information about the device and software ("browser") used to access the site.</li>
                        <li>The requested URLs which are unique identifiers for data and other resources requested from our servers.</li>

                    These logs are maintained for security reasons and to ensure strong application performance but are anonymized within 7 days of collection. These anonymized statistics are maintained indefinently as aggregated information for us to understand usage patterns in order to improve the service and maintain its performance. The anonymized data may also include error or bug reports. That said, and no other presonal identifying information is collected including email address, phone number, race, ethnicity, age, etc. Furthermore, please note that:
